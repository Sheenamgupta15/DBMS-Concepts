Database users are categorized based up on their interaction with the database. These are seven types of database users in DBMS.

1. Database Administrator (DBA) : Database Administrator (DBA) is a person/team who defines the schema and also controls the 3 levels of database. The DBA will then create a new account id and password for the user if he/she need to access the database. DBA is also responsible for providing security to the database and he allows only the authorized users to access/modify the data base. DBA is responsible for the problems such as security breaches and poor system response time.
  -DBA also monitors the recovery and backup and provide technical support.
  -The DBA has a DBA account in the DBMS which called a system or superuser account.
  -DBA repairs damage caused due to hardware and/or software failures.
  -DBA is the one having privileges to perform DCL (Data Control Language) operations such as GRANT and REVOKE, to allow/restrict a particular user from accessing the database.
2. Naive / Parametric End Users : Parametric End Users are the unsophisticated who don’t have any DBMS knowledge but they frequently use the database applications in their daily life to get the desired results. For examples, Railway’s ticket booking users are naive users. Clerks in any bank is a naive user because they don’t have any DBMS knowledge but they still use the database and perform their given task.
3. System Analyst :System Analyst is a user who analyzes the requirements of parametric end users. They check whether all the requirements of end users are satisfied.
4. Sophisticated Users : Sophisticated users can be engineers, scientists, business analyst, who are familiar with the database. They can develop their own database applications according to their requirement. They don’t write the program code but they interact the database by writing SQL queries directly through the query processor.
5. Database Designers : Data Base Designers are the users who design the structure of database which includes tables, indexes, views, triggers, stored procedures and constraints which are usually enforced before the database is created or populated with data. He/she controls what data must be stored and how the data items to be related. It is responsibility of Database Designers to understand the requirements of different user groups and then create a design which satisfies the need of all the user groups.
6. Application Programmers : Application Programmers also referred as System Analysts or simply Software Engineers, are the back-end programmers who writes the code for the application programs. They are the computer professionals. These programs could be written in Programming languages such as Visual Basic, Developer, C, FORTRAN, COBOL etc. Application programmers design, debug, test, and maintain set of programs called “canned transactions” for the Naive (parametric) users in order to interact with database.
7. Casual Users / Temporary Users : Casual Users are the users who occasionally use/access the database but each time when they access the database they require the new information, for example, Middle or higher level manager.
8. Specialized users : Specialized users are sophisticated users who write specialized database application that does not fit into the traditional data-processing framework. Among these applications are computer aided-design systems, knowledge-base and expert systems etc.

* Categories of End Users
  End users are basically those people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating, and generating reports. The database primarily exists for their use. There are several categories of end-users these are as follows.

1. Casual End users
2. Naive or Parametric End Users
3. Application Programmers
4. Sophisticated End Users
5. Standalone Users
6. Specialised Users
7. Casual End Users - These are the users who occasionally access the database but they require different information each time. They use a sophisticated database query language basically to specify their request and are typically middle or level managers or other occasional browsers. These users learn very few facilities that they may use repeatedly from the multiple facilities provided by DBMS to access it. 
8. Naive or Parametric End Users- These are the users who basically make up a sizeable portion of database end-users. The main job function revolves basically around constantly querying and updating the database for this we basically use a standard type of query known as the canned transaction that has been programmed and tested. These users need to learn very little about the facilities provided by the DBMS they basically have to understand the users’ interfaces of the standard transaction designed and implemented for their use. The following tasks are basically performed by Naive end-users: 
  -The person who is working in the bank will basically tell us the account balance and post-withdrawal and deposits. 
  -Reservation clerks for airlines, railways, hotels, and car rental companies basically check availability for a given request and make the reservation. 
  -Clerks who are working at receiving end for shipping companies enter the package identified via barcodes and descriptive information through buttons to update a central database of received and in-transit packages. 
9. Application Programmers- The application programmers write different application programs and are responsible for developing the user interface. The application programmers are free to develop the user interfaces in any preferred language such as C/C++/Java etc.
10. Sophisticated End Users - These users basically include engineers, scientists, business analytics, and others who thoroughly familiarize themselves with the facilities of the DBMS in order to implement their application to meet their complex requirements. These users try to learn most of the DBMS facilities in order to achieve their complex requirements. 
11. Standalone Users - These are those users whose job is basically to maintain personal databases by using a ready-made program package that provides easy-to-use menu-based or graphics-based interfaces, An example is the user of a tax package that basically stores a variety of personal financial data for tax purposes. These users become very proficient in using a specific software package.
12. Specialised Users- The special users are responsible for writing specialized database-related programs and also have the task of creating the actual database as well as implementing technical controls needed to enforce policies and decisions.
